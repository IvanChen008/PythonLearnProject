Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years----Peter Norvig

Researchers (Bloom (1985), Bryan & Harter (1899), Hayes (1989), Simmon & Chase (1973)) 
have shown it takes about ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, 
including chess playing, music composition, telegraph operation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis,
and research in neuropsychology and topology. The key is deliberative practice: 
not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability,
trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes.
Then repeat. And repeat again. There appear to be no real shortcuts: even Mozart, who was a musical 
prodigy at age 4, took 13 more years before he began to produce world-class music. In another genre, the Beatles 
seemed to burst onto the scene with a string of #1 hits and an appearance on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964. 
But they had been playing small clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg since 1957, and while 
they had mass appeal early on, their first great critical success, Sgt. Peppers, was released in 1967.
